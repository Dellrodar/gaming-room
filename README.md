Repo for Gaming Room
- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a game company looking to expand thier current mobile game Draw It or Lose It to multiple platforms, both for web and iOS. The game was currently only available on the Android platform. 

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In my opinion, I think the evaluation prtion came out well. It showed clear pros and cons of each of the different platforms for evaluation.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found both the UML documentation and the summary the most helpful when coding. The summary provided and overview in which to make the UML on to help clarify the design.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could improve a section, it would be the Evalutation. While I thought it covered all the basic information needed, it also could have been more in-depth. I think with greater information, it could serve a much clearer picture.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

In each portion of this document the users needs were put formost. For example, since the user want to expand across the current platform they were on, they would need a platform that was agnostic for thier systems to host on. This would not only ensure the stabily of the app deployed, but maximize the compatability to serve the users needs.

It is important to consider the users needs so that there are no unessacary or expensive changes down the development cycle. Starting off on a bad foundation or designing yourself into a corner came be both a costly and time consuming mistake. This also would erode the users confidence and trust in the app we would be designing.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The approach to designing the software for The Gaming Room involved considering cross-platform functionality, ensuring unique identifiers for players and teams, and maintaining a single game instance at all times. The design utilized an entity-relationship model, employing a superclass to connect game, team, and player components, which enhances inheritance and scalability. Future strategies for similar software applications will include using cloud hosting due to its stability and cost-effectiveness, leveraging cloud storage for scalability and backup security, and employing efficient memory management to prevent overload. Additionally, a cloud-based hosting provider will improve performance, while security measures such as HTTPS and secure authentication will be implemented to safeguard user data.
